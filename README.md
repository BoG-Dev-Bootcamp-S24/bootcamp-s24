# Spring 24 Dev Bootcamp Exercises
This repository contains all the exercises and resources needed for the Spring 2024 Dev Bootcamp.

## Submitting Projects & Exercises
Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen. 

At the beginning of the semester, Bootcampers should fork the `bootcamp-s24` repository into this organization. Follow the instructions in [Exercise 2](https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24/bootcamp-s24/tree/main/exer2) to get started!

This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. As a bootcamper, you'll be uploading all of your exercise submissions to your forked repository. Make sure to frequently **Sync Fork** to make sure you have up-to-date exercises and projects!
