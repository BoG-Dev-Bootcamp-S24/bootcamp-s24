Objective:
Now that you have completed Level 1 and have a basic To-Do list where you can add tasks, your next challenge is to add the ability to remove tasks from the list. This involves enhancing your JavaScript skills and understanding of DOM manipulation.

Tasks:
Modify Existing JavaScript (script.js):
Update the event listener for adding tasks to include a remove button for each task.
Implement functionality to remove a task from the list when the remove button is clicked. Use the .removeChild() method for this purpose.
Update CSS (style.css):
The CSS file has been updated to include styles for the new remove button. Make sure to check these changes and understand how they affect the layout and appearance of your To-Do list.
Notes:
JavaScript Functionality:

Each task you add to the list should now have an accompanying remove button.
Clicking the remove button should delete the task from the list.
Ensure your code handles these actions efficiently and maintains a clean user interface.
CSS Changes:

Familiarize yourself with the new CSS rules for the remove button. This will help you in further customizing the style if needed.
