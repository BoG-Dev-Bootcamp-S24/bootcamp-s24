## Instructions
This exercise involves setting up your GitHub repo in the BoG Dev Bootcamp Organization. This repo is where you will submit all exercises throughout the bootcamp. 

1. Go to the [bootcamp-s24](https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24/bootcamp-s24) repo on GitHub
2. Click **Fork** in the top right corner
3. Change the **Owner** to **BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24**
4. Rename the repo `bootcamp-s24-yourname`
5. Click **Create Fork**
6. When the new repo has been created, click **Code** and **HTTPS** and copy the text
7. Open Terminal or Git Bash on your computer and clone the repo with the command `git clone https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp-S24/bootcamp-s24-yourname.git` (make sure you know where this folder is located for future reference)
8. Navigate into the `bootcamp-s24-yourname` directory that was just created via the clone command
9. Navigate into the `exer2` folder
10. Add the intro card files you wrote for your bootcamp application into the folder
11. Stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub

**Word of advice for future exercises** -> Before starting an exercise, make sure your repo is up-to-date with the main repo (we will be updating it with new exercises regularly!). Check by clicking **Sync Fork** and **Update branch** if needed. Then pull the changes to your local repo with `git pull origin main`.
