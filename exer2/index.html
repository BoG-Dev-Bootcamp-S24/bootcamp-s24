            Hello, my name is Ivan Wang and I am a 2nd year student at Georgia Tech. 
            I major in Computer Science with a concentration in intelligence and info-internetworks. 
            Previously in high school, I've been involved in a variety of volunteering clubs. 
            I volunteered for the elderly, tutored underclassmen, and even ran a local food drive. 
            Specifically, I was the school service chairperson for my high school's chapter of Family Community Leaders (FCL). 
            I am deeply passionate about helping out the community and still try to be involved today. 
            Although I attend college in Georgia, I am actually from Massachusetts!
