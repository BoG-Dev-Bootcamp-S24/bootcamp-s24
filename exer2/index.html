                <p class="times" padding="5px">Throughout my life, I have been very fortunate to have access to many opportunities. 
                    From varsity sports like tennis or basketball, to academic clubs like science bowl 
                    or computer science club, I have had many options available to me. However, many kids 
                    across the world, especially those from underrepresented groups or refugee familes, 
                    are kept from these priveleges that are thought to be normal to the average citizen. 
                    So, my goal is to make this situation better for as many kids as I can!</p>
